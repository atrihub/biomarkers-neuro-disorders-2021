# biomarkers-neuro-disorders-2021
This repository hosts the course materials for the biostatistics module of the [Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Disorders](https://fubasdoc.gu.se/fubasextern/info?kurs=SN00030) course at University of Gothenburg, May 24 to 28, 2021.

Statistical and visualization techniques will be demonstrated using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) applied to data from the [Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/). If you would like to execute the R code on your own machine, you should [apply for access](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/) to ADNI and [download and install the ADNIMERGE R package](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/instruction-ADNIMERGE-packages.pdf).

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is also highly recommended.


The biostatistics module is from *16:00 to 19:00 (Gothenburg) Wednesday May 26, 2021*. Topics include:
